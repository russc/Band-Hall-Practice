Check out the [Live Demo](https://bandhallpractice.firebaseapp.com/#/).  Students register the first time they clock in, then it remembers them.  After that, simply entering your student id will clock you in as "currently practicing".  The teacher can clock everyone out at once by typing "closeAll" in the student id text input.  All currently practicing students will be clocked out and their practice session is then added to the count on the leader board.  The teacher can see details of each student's practice sessions by typing "directorLog" in the student id text input.
